# yikyakweather

A Ruby script using Selenium and (eventually) Weather.io to post the weather daily on my local YikYak board. The post in the end will contain various emjois like :sunny: for sunny or :umbrella: for raining. 

"clear-day" :sunny:
"clear-night" :crescent_moon:
"rain" :umbrella:
"snow" :snowflake:
"sleet" no emoji, may need to just type it
"wind" emoji not widely supported yet
"fog" :foggy:
"cloudy" :cloud:
"partly-cloudy-day" :partly_sunny:
